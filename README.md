## About the project

During the time of writing our [bachelor’s thesis](https://github.com/philiparvidsson/Sequence-to-Sequence-Learning-of-Financial-Time-Series), we delved deeper into various financial markets. We decided we might as well start trading while waiting for our predictive models to complete their calculations (taking *hours* at a time—literally). To keep track of our investments easily, we developed PORTFOLIO.
